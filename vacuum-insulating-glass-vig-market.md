<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempered VIG</li><li>Non-tempered VIG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) can be classified into two main types: Tempered VIG and Non-tempered VIG. Tempered VIG is glass that has been treated with heat to increase its strength and durability, making it less likely to break under pressure. On the other hand, Non-tempered VIG does not go through the same heat treatment process, making it more susceptible to breakage. Both types of VIG offer enhanced insulation properties compared to traditional single or double pane windows, helping to improve energy efficiency in buildings.</p></p>
