<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Oil Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive oil level sensors are available in two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact type sensors rely on direct physical contact with the oil to measure its level, typically using a float or probe. On the other hand, non-contact type sensors use ultrasonic or optical technology to measure the oil level without actually touching the oil. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, and are used in various automotive applications based on the specific requirements of the vehicle and system.</p></p>
