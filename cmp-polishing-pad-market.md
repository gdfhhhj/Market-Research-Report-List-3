<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Polishing Pad Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard CMP Pads</li><li>Soft CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMP polishing pad market consists of two main types: hard CMP pads and soft CMP pads. Hard CMP pads are designed with a high stiffness and abrasive surface, making them suitable for removing a significant amount of material during the polishing process. On the other hand, soft CMP pads are made with a more flexible and less abrasive structure, ideal for achieving finer polishing results and reducing defects on delicate substrates. The choice between hard and soft CMP pads depends on the desired polishing requirements and the specific characteristics of the materials being processed.</p></p>
