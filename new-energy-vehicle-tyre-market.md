<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial tyres are designed with distinct layers of fabric running perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better stability, handling, and fuel efficiency. They are commonly used in modern vehicles due to their superior performance. On the other hand, bias tyres have fabric layers running at an angle to the direction of travel, offering a smoother ride and better puncture resistance. They are commonly used in older vehicles or in specific applications where their unique characteristics are advantageous. Both tyre types cater to different market needs based on vehicle requirements and performance preferences.</p></p>
