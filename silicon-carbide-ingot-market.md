<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Carbide Ingot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N-type</li><li>Semi-insulated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon Carbide Ingot Market can be classified into three main types - N-type, Semi-insulated type, and P-type. N-type silicon carbide ingots have nitrogen doping which imparts them with electron donor properties, ideal for power devices. Semi-insulated silicon carbide ingots have reduced impurity levels, offering high resistivity and low electrical conductivity, making them suitable for high-frequency applications. P-type silicon carbide ingots, on the other hand, have boron doping, providing them with electron acceptor properties, suited for optoelectronic devices.</p></p>
