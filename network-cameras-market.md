<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras are commonly used in surveillance systems where all video processing and storage is done in a central location. These cameras are connected to a central network video recorder (NVR) for recording and management. On the other hand, Decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage capabilities and can operate independently without the need for a central NVR. They are typically used in smaller surveillance systems where a centralized setup may not be necessary. Both types offer advantages depending on the specific needs and scale of the surveillance system.</p></p>
