<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Needle-free Infusion Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Non Positive Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Needle-free infusion connectors are divided into two main types: positive pressure and non-positive pressure connectors. Positive pressure connectors utilize a spring-loaded mechanism to actively push fluid into the patient's bloodstream, ensuring a secure and efficient infusion process. On the other hand, non-positive pressure connectors rely on the patient's own fluid pressure to facilitate the infusion, making them more suitable for low-flow applications. Both types offer a safe and convenient alternative to traditional needle-based infusion methods, reducing the risk of needle-stick injuries and infections.</p></p>
