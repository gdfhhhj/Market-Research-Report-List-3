<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Fundus Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic</li><li>Non-mydriatic</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Benchtop fundus cameras come in three main types: mydriatic, non-mydriatic, and hybrid. Mydriatic cameras use dilating eye drops to fully examine the retina, providing detailed images but requiring longer recovery time for patients. Non-mydriatic cameras eliminate the need for dilating drops, making the process faster and more comfortable for patients. Hybrid cameras combine both mydriatic and non-mydriatic capabilities, providing flexibility for different clinical needs. Each type serves a unique purpose in capturing high-quality images of the eye's interior.</p></p>
