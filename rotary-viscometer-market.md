<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cylinder Type</li><li>Cone-Plate Type</li><li>Parallel-Plate Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary viscometer market is categorized into three types: cylinder type, cone-plate type, and parallel-plate type. The cylinder type viscometers feature a rotating cylinder immersed in the sample liquid, measuring the torque required for rotation, thereby determining the viscosity. Cone-plate viscometers consist of a cone-shaped rotor rotating against a stationary plate, with the viscosity measured based on the torque. Parallel-plate viscometers use two parallel plates with a sample placed between them, and the viscosity is determined by measuring the resistance to shear flow. These variations cater to different viscosity measurement requirements in various industries.</p></p>
