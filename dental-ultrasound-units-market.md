<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Ultrasound Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetostrictive</li><li>Piezoelectric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental ultrasound units are used for various dental procedures like scaling and root planning. There are two main types of ultrasound units used in dentistry: magnetostrictive and piezoelectric. </p><p>Magnetostrictive units use a metal stack that expands and contracts when a magnetic field is applied, creating ultrasonic vibrations. These units are effective for heavy calculus removal.</p><p>Piezoelectric units, on the other hand, use crystals that create vibrations when an electric current is applied. These units are more gentle and precise, making them suitable for delicate procedures like periodontal surgery.</p></p>
