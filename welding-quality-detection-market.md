<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Quality Detection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Destructive Detection</li><li>Non-destructive Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The welding quality detection market is divided into two types: destructive detection and non-destructive detection. Destructive detection involves assessing the quality of welded joints by physically removing or destroying a sample. This method can provide accurate results but may damage the welded piece. On the other hand, non-destructive detection employs techniques like ultrasonic testing or X-ray inspection to analyze welded joints without causing any harm to the workpiece. This method is reliable and ensures the integrity of the weld while maintaining the structural stability of the object being tested.</p></p>
