<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Prefilters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid or Screen</li><li>Spongy Looking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air prefilters come in two main types: grid or screen and spongy-looking. Grid or screen prefilters are typically made of a rigid material such as metal or plastic, with a grid-like structure to trap larger particles from entering the main filtration system. On the other hand, spongy-looking prefilters are made of a soft, porous material that resembles a sponge. These prefilters are designed to capture smaller particles and provide additional filtration for air purification systems. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and longevity of the main filtration system.</p></p>
