<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Compression Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic</li><li>Static</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical compression pumps fall into two main types: dynamic and static. Dynamic compression pumps utilize air pressure to deliver intermittent pulses of pressure to the affected area, promoting circulation and reducing swelling. Static compression pumps, on the other hand, deliver a consistent level of pressure to the affected area without fluctuation. Both types of pumps are used to treat conditions such as lymphedema, venous insufficiency, and deep vein thrombosis. The choice between dynamic and static compression pumps depends on the specific needs of the patient and the condition being treated.</p></p>
